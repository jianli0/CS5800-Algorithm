<center><h1>CS5800 Algorithms Spring 2014 Assignment #6</h1></center>
<p>

1. (30 points) A train is given to two children as a gift. A train consists of
a sequence of cars connected in a single line.  There is an even number of
cars, and the two children wish to divide them up. They do this by taking one
car at a time from one end of the train. The older child goes first. Each car
has a value to each child. and they want to maximize the value of the cars that
they select. Note that the same car could be valued differently by the two
children. Develop an algorithm for finding the best strategy for each
child. The time complexity of your algorithm must be at most quadratic in the
number of cars. If there happens to be a situation where the two choices for a
child have the same value, then the child will make the choice which is best
for the other child.  It is not necessary to prove that your algorithm is
correct, but you must prove that it is quadratic.
</p><p>

2. (25 points) In this problem we look at two translations of Aristotle's Metaphysics.
The first one (by W.D. Ross) begins like this:
</p><p>

"All men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take
in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for
themselves; and above all others the sense of sight. For not only with a view
to action, but even when we are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one
might say) to everything else. The reason is that this, most of all the senses,
makes us know and brings to light many differences between things."

</p><p>
Another (by Hugh Tredennick) begins like this:
</p><p>
"All men naturally desire knowledge. An indication of this is our esteem for
the senses; for apart from their use we esteem them for their own sake, and
most of all the sense of sight. Not only with a view to action, but even when
no action is contemplated, we prefer sight, generally speaking, to all the
other senses. The reason of this is that of all the senses sight best helps us
to know things, and reveals many distinctions."
</p><p>

To compare them, we align them word-by-word so as to maximize the alignment
score. A matching word scores 10 points.  Two words that have the same meaning
but differ only in form (e.g., singular versus plural or different part of speech) are also
considered a match but score only 5 points. A gap (insertion or deletion)
scores -5 points for a noun, pronoun or verb, and scores 0 points for other
parts of speech. Perform alignment separately for each major clause. Show the
alignments and the scores for the first two major clauses (i.e., up to the word
"senses"). (Note that mismatches other than words that differ in form are not
allowed.)
</p><p>
Do not ask a TA, a classmate or anyone else about whether two words
differ only by a part of speech, or what part of speech a word is.
</p><p>
3. (20 points) Compute the all-pairs shortest path lengths for the following graph:
</p><p>
<table cellpadding="5" border="0">
<tbody><tr><th>Edge</th><th>Length</th><th>Edge</th><th>Length</th><th>Edge</th><th>Length</th><th>Edge</th><th>Length
</th></tr><tr><td>(1,3)</td><td>-3</td><td>(1,4)</td><td>1</td><td>(2,4)</td><td>7</td><td>(2,5)</td><td>8
</td></tr><tr><td>(3,4)</td><td>8</td><td>(3,5)</td><td>9</td><td>(4,2)</td><td>2</td><td>(4,3)</td><td>10
</td></tr><tr><td>(4,5)</td><td>9</td><td>(5,3)</td><td>-1
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
Show your answer as a sequence of 5x5 matrices. You do not have to show the shortest paths.

</p><p>


4. (25 points) Suppose that one has a collection of coins with denominations
d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, ..., d<sub>n</sub>. The denominations are
distinct positive integers, and one has an unlimited supply of coins of each
denomination. You wish to determine whether it is possible to select a set of
coins so as to make a total value v. Moreover, if it is possible, then you want
to know the minimum number of coins that are needed to make the value v.
Express this problem as a DP problem, and prove that your DP algorithm is
correct.
