<center><h1>CS5800 Algorithms Spring 2014 Solution to Assignment #10</h1></center>
<p>

1. (15 points) Your company requires that you develop a program that will
generate a random widget.  You don't actually know what a widget is because
that is a trade secret. However, you have been given a program that will
generate a random gadget. (You don't know what a gadget is either.) You also
have been given a program that will test whether a gadget is a widget. However,
the test program is very crude. If your gadget is a widget, your test program
will be wrong 99% of the time. If your gadget is not a widget, your test
program will always be correct. Your program can be run repeatedly on the same
gadget, and each test result will be independent. Your program must be 99%
certain that it has a widget.  Develop an algorithm using pseudo-code for
generating a random widget.

</p><p>

<font color="blue">
</font></p><pre><font color="blue">Input: None
Output: A widget with 99% certainty
  Loop forever
    Generate a random gadget
    Test gadget for being a widget with 99% certainty
    If gadget is widget return the gadget
  End of loop
</font></pre><font color="blue">
<p>
</p><pre>Test gadget for being a widget with 99% certainty
Input: gadget
Output: True if gadget is widget with 99% certainty, else false.
  Loop 459 times
    Perform test of gadget
    If gadget is widget return true
  End of Loop
  return false
</pre>
</font><p><font color="blue">

If any of the gadget tests say the gadget is a widget, then the gadget is a
widget, and the tests can be stopped, since the only way that the test will
report that the gadget is a widget is when it really is a widget. However, this
does not happen very often. We need to repeat the test until we are 99% certain
that the gadget is not a widget at which point we try another gadget. The
probability that a single test will say that the gadget is not a widget even
though the gadget is a widget is 0.99. The probability of n independent tests
saying that the gadget is not a widget even though the gadget is a widget is
0.99<sup>n</sup>.  We want this to be less than 0.01. Solving 0.99<sup>n</sup>
= 0.01 for n gives n = 458.21. So n must be 459 to ensure that 0.99<sup>n</sup>
will be at most 0.01.

</font>
</p><p>

2. (20 points) Now suppose that the program in Question #1 above for testing
whether a gadget is a widget will also sometimes be wrong when the gadget is
not a widget. Modify your algorithm to handle the following two cases:
</p><ol type="a">
<li>When the gadget is not a widget, the test will be incorrect 10% of the time.

<font color="blue">
As explained in class, we must choose n so that the confidence intervals
do not overlap. If the probabilities are p and q, and if the number of
tests n that are performed is large, then the normal distribution is a
very good approximation. The 99% confidence intervals are
<pre>[np-2.6&#8730;(np(1-p)),np+2.6&#8730;(np(1-p))]
</pre>
and
<pre>[nq-2.6&#8730;(nq(1-q)),nq+2.6&#8730;(nq(1-q))]
</pre>
So we must solve np+2.6&#8730;(np(1-p)) = nq-2.6&#8730;(nq(1-q)) for n
when p=0.01 and q=0.1. The result is n=133.2. So n must be 134
to ensure that the two confidence intervals are disjoint. The common endpoint
is about 4.3. Here is the pseudocode:
<p>
</p><pre>Input: None
Output: A widget with 99% certainty
  Loop forever
    Generate a random gadget
    Test gadget for being a widget with 99% certainty
    If gadget is widget return the gadget
  End of loop
</pre>
<p>
</p><pre>Test gadget for being a widget with 99% certainty
Input: gadget
Output: True if gadget is widget with 99% certainty, else false.
  widget count = 0
  Loop 134 times
    Perform test of gadget
    if result of test is widget increment widget count
  End of Loop
  if widget count less than or equal to 4 return true
  else return false
</pre>
<p>

It is counter-intuitive that when the widget count is higher than 4 one should
conclude that the gadget is not a widget. One would think that if the test
reports more often that the gadget is a widget, then it is more likely to be a
widget.  However, when the gadget is a widget, the test will report that the
gadget is a widget only 1% of the time, but if the gadget is not a widget, the
test reports that it is a widget much more often: 10% of the time.

</p><p>

The following more sophisticated analysis requires a background in probability
and statistics:

</p></font><p><font color="blue">

If one uses the binomial distribution directly (i.e., without using the normal
approximation), then it is only necessary to loop 113 times rather than 134
times.  This computation uses one-sided rather than two-sided confidence
intervals, If one uses one-sided confidence intervals and the normal
approximation, then one must only loop 106 times. The best answer is 113, but
the other two are also acceptable.

</font>

</p><p>

</p></li><li>When the gadget is not a widget, the test will be incorrect 1% of the time.
<p>
<font color="blue">
This is not possible. The two distributions are the same, so one can never
perform enough tests to distinguish them.
</font>
</p><p>

</p></li></ol>

<p>
3. (20 points) An experiment is studying two factors, each of which has four
possible values, for a total of 16 combinations of the two factors. The
experimental design is a 4×4 grid where in each row and column each value
of a factor occurs exactly once. For example, for just the first factor the
grid might look like this:
</p><p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D
</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>A
</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>A</td><td>B
</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>
where the four possible values of the first factor are A, B, C and D. An
additional constraint is that all 16 combinations of the two factors must each
occur exactly once in the grid. Develop a 3SAT expression that specifies the
requirements of this experimental design. Some of the grid entries already have
one or the other factor specified, and it is required to extend the design to
the rest of the grid. Show how one can specify these grid entries in your 3SAT
expression. It isn't necessary to write out the entire expression. It is enough
to show how it can be constructed.
</p><p>

<font color="blue">

One possible solution is to introduce boolean variables for each of the
combinations and each of the grid locations. Additional variables must be
introduced to convert the expression to 3SAT. So there are 16 * 16 = 256
variables in all.  For example, one might name the variables Xrcuv, where r is
a row (from 1 to 4), c is a column (from 1 to 4), u is a value of the first
factor (1 to 4) and v is a value of the second factor (from 1 to 4).

</font></p><ol><font color="blue">

<li>Every grid location has exactly one value for each factor.

<ol>
<li>

For every r, c, v, (Xrc1v or Xrc2v or Xrc3v or Xrc4v) and (-Xrc1v or -Xrc2v)
and (-Xrc1v or -Xrc3v) and (-Xrc1v or -Xrc4v) and (-Xrc2v or -Xrc3v) and
(-Xrc2v or -Xrc4v) and (-Xrc3v or -Xrc4v). The first clause must be converted
to 3SAT.

</li><li>

and (-Xrcu1 or -Xrcu3) and (-Xrcu1 or -Xrcu4) and (-Xrcu2 or -Xrcu3) and
(-Xrcu2 or -Xrcu4) and (-Xrcu3 or -Xrcu4). The first clause must be converted
to 3SAT.

</li></ol>

</li><li>Every row has each value of each factor exactly once:<p>for every r, u, v,
 (Xr1uv or Xr2uv or Xr3uv or Xr4uv) and (-Xr1uv or -Xr2uv) and (-Xr1uv or
 -Xr3uv) and (-Xr1uv or -Xr4uv) and (-Xr2uv or -Xr3uv) and (-Xr2uv or -Xr4uv)
 and (-Xr3uv or -Xr4uv). The first clause must be converted to 3SAT.

</p></li><li>Every column has each value of each factor exactly once:<p> for every c, u,
v: (X1cuv or X2cuv or X3cuv or X4cuv) and (-X1cuv or -X2cuv) and (-X1cuv or
-X3cuv) and (-X1cuv or -X4cuv) and (-X2cuv or -X3cuv) and (-X2cuv or -X4cuv)
and (-X3cuv or -X4cuv). The first clause must be converted to 3SAT.

</p></li><li>Every combination of values occurs exactly once. It is enough to specify
that each combination occurs at least once. If this is true, then no
combination can occur more than once since the number of combinations is the
same as the number of grid locations: <p>for every u, v, (X11uv or X12uv or
X13uv or X14uv or X21uv or X22uv or X23uv or X24uv or X31uv or X32uv or X33uv
or X34uv or X41uv or X42uv or X43uv or X44uv). An additional 13 variables
are needed to convert this clause to 3SAT.

</p></li></font></ol><font color="blue">
</font><p><font color="blue">

To specify part of an experimental design, add unit clauses. For each grid
point in row r and column c that is required to have value u for the first factor
and value v for the second factor, add the unit clause (Xrcuv).

When there is a choice of which variable to use, the variable that is
lexicographically first should be used, and branch by setting a variable first
to true and then to false.  Show recursive
calls to DPLL using begin and end with the depth of recursion (starting at 0).
Apply only unit propagation, and only once per recursive call to DPLL.

5. (15 points) A University has 15 nonoverlapping time slots for courses, 9
slots on a MWF schedule, and 6 slots on a TTh schedule. Student enroll in
courses before the slots and rooms are allocated for the courses. The courses
must be given slots so that no pair of courses with a common student are
scheduled for the same slot. There is no limit on the number of rooms.  Propose
a way to determine whether the slots can be allocated, and if they can, then
find an allocation. Determine the complexity class of this problem, and prove
it.
</p><p>
<font color="blue">

Express this as an instance of the 15-color problem. The undirected graph has
one node for each course. There is an undirected edge joining two nodes if
there is a student who has enrolled in the courses represented by the two
nodes. A time slot is one color. The courses can be allocated to the slots if
and only if the graph can be colored with the 15 colors so that no two nodes
joined by an edge have the same color. The decision problem tells one whether
the courses can be allocated time slots. A coloring is an allocation. This
problem is therefore NP-complete because the 15-color problem is NP-complete.
